# TM_Prototyping

## Assumptions/Explanations

### Reuse jQuery
We follow the template example to reuse jQuery.

### Task 1:
Besides highlighting the selected item on clicking, highlighting on mouse-hovering as well for a clearer visual indication where now a user is.

### Task 2:
This task requires the *dynamically* loading template files so we take the iframe approach.

### Task 3:
This task borrows from the 3rd-party lib, flow.js, to draw the data chart.


### Task 4:
We display the weather icons based on the openweathermap api: https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions
